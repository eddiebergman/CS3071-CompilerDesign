Exercise 3
Modify the method CloseScope (in SymTab.cs) so that it adds comments to the file Tastier.s which, for each identifier found during the compilation of a program, describes the contents of the symbol table (eg its type and address).
 
For example, when compiling the sample program TastierProgram.TAS, the identifiers Add, Subtract, SumUp and Main should be described as procedures; i should be described a global variable of type int and sum as a local variable of type int, etc.
 
Note:   This exercise will not be graded, but please submit (using Blackboard) a brief report along with your modified version of the file SymTab.cs â€” this should be done before 10:00pm next Monday (16th October).
