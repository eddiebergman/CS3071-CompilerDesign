did for loop

BreakStat, used inconjuction with Subscopes, openscope with a label that should be placed before subscope is closed
made it a stat
checks if it's in correct place
redid other statments to incorporate it (switch)

moved declarations to statements
moved everything to Stat, makes program a lot more flexible.

arrayDecl now just calculates dimensional info
moved arrayConstruction properly to symbol table

redo type system
Now a class to represent a type and associated information

create struct prod rule in ATG
int nextType for keeping key for different types available
